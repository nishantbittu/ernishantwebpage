                <p id="aboutme">I  have always liked to know why things happen, and then, I love explain those things to someone, teach him. When I was younger, I used to pretend to be the teacher while playing with my little brother; I liked giving her homework, ask her questions, tests, teach her different stuffs. Since I was little I have felt attracted to computer, transmit my knowledge to others, but first it is necessary learn, and then teach. When I am free in holydays then I spend more and more times with computer like for playing game, watching movies, and learning coding. My school really helped with that, with its educational model Gourdieff, I developed love for learning new things, from different areas, I gained motivation for knowledge. Personally I Give thanks to our higher school computer teacher Mr. Shubham Tejasv who give me the way for bright future in the computer field. <br>
                    My desire to know everything and learn more, added to the trips to the south of Chile with my family every summer. A very wide career, with many different areas of study, such as ,computer science, math, biology, genetic, statistics, physics, among others. A world full of things to learn and discover.
